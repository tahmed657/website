         <div class="description">
            Balancing schoolwork and social life as a CUNY student can be challenging, especially with busy schedules, long commutes, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities. The core issue is how to manage time effectively, maintain academic performance, and still have opportunities to socialize and maintain mental health. Many students struggle to find a balance, leading to burnout, stress, or academic decline if one aspect is prioritized over the other.</div>
