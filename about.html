                <p> Hello! I'm Tahsin, currently a senior at The City College of New York, where I’m pursuing a major in Digital Design and a minor in Business. My journey in digital design is driven by a fascination with the synergy of creativity and technology, and I’m passionate about shaping engaging, user-centered experiences that leave a lasting impact.
                As a digital design enthusiast, I thrive on bringing concepts to life through visually compelling and functional designs. I’m continuously honing my skills in tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Figma, and p5.js, always eager to explore new platforms and technologies to elevate my design work.</p>
                    
                <p>Beyond design, my business minor has equipped me with insights into market research, user behavior, and brand strategy, which I integrate into my projects to create solutions that are not only visually appealing but also strategically effective. I’ve had hands-on experience in both individual and collaborative projects, where I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the iterative design process and user-centered thinking.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, I aim to contribute to the world of UX/UI design by creating experiences that balance functionality with beauty. My ultimate goal is to design products that genuinely improve users’ lives, enhancing both the digital landscape and user satisfaction. </p>
                <p>If you have any questions, design challenges, or collaboration opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out at Tahsinahmed657@gmail.com. I’m always open to connecting with fellow creatives, learning from new perspectives, and making meaningful contributions to the field of digital design.</p>
